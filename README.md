# About

This is a basic CLI application where you can track your progress on overcoming
bad habits, like smoking or drinking for example.

This is still work in progress, so there are some things I need to fix. The main idea
is to ship along with the CLI a shell script so you can launch a terminal when
your system boots up for the first time every day and you can see your progress
before deep diving in your work.

I'am honestly building this application for personal use, but if other computer
folk out there are fighting to overcome some bad habits too, I hope that this
helps some way ;).
